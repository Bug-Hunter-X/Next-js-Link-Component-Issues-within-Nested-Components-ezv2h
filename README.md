# Next.js Link Component Issue within Nested Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Next.js `Link` component within nested components. The issue is that the navigation provided by the `Link` component behaves unexpectedly and doesn't always redirect as intended.

## Issue Description
The `Link` component in the `pages/about.js` file does not work correctly and doesn't navigate to the '/contact' page when clicked. This occurs because the internal structure or context within the nested components may interfere with Next.js's routing mechanism.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Navigate to the `/about` page.
5. Click the link to the `/contact` page.  The link will likely not function correctly. 

## Solution
The provided solution explains and demonstrates how to use the Next.js `Link` component appropriately within nested components to avoid any unexpected navigation behavior.
